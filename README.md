# Cache-Simulator

## Overview
This Cache Simulator is a tool designed in C for simulating the behavior of a cache memory within a computer system. It supports various cache organizations including direct mapped, set associative, and fully associative caches. The simulator provides insights into how different cache configurations affect performance in terms of cache hits and misses.

## Features
Support for Multiple Cache Organizations: Direct Mapped, Set Associative, and Fully Associative caches.
Customizable Cache Settings: Users can adjust cache size, block size, and associativity levels to explore various configurations.
Memory Reference Processing: Takes a stream of memory references to simulate and analyze cache behavior.
Performance Metrics: Outputs cache hit and miss rates to help users understand and optimize cache performance.
